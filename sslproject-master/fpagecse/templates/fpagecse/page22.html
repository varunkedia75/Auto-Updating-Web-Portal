The department aptly makes use of the technical facility of the workshop in teaching and in sett
						ing up of in-house experimental set-ups. Apart from carrying out practica
						l classes as per academic curriculum, workshop caters to needs of differen
						t departments of the Institute in terms of executing works of their B.Tech.
						, M.Tech. and Ph.D. students as well as other related research/consultancy w
						orks. The department also welcomes students from other departments of the ins
						titute as a gesture of support to their time-to-time academic and research need
						s. Both undergraduates and postgraduates are well placed in leading industries a
						s well as in the higher research level institutions of international recognition.
